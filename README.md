# Botsetta-Scone
---

### Hail Botsetta!
This bot will meet all your needs for 21st century Discord. Trouble coming up with puns to shut up that one annoying friend up? Need some help letting someone know their place pirate-style? Want to act sophisticated when everyone on the server knows you are a caveman _(or woman, we don't judge)_?

Introducing **Botsetta**, your one stop shop for message manipulation.
There are a couple handy commands you can use to get the edge on your server-mates:

##### Pirate Botsetta
**``` !pirate Hello there, I am having a great time ```**
> Ahoy there, I be havin' a great time 

##### Corporate Slang Botsetta
**``` !corpbs ```**
> Credibly Seize Emerging Strategic Theme Areas

##### Punny Botsetta
**``` It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.```**
> Your Mama so dumb she climbed over a glass wall to see what was on the other side.
##### How does Botsetta work?
Botsetta slaps the requests out of some APIs to get the pirate translation and corporate slang terms. Getting the puns is not so easy. Botsetta takes a message from a channel, pulls out nouns from them using the **Oxford Dictionary API** and queries a jokes API using the noun and gives you a joke that will have you in tears. ~~(Tears of Pain)~~

##### What does Botsetta look like? 
Untill she agrees to sit down and have us take a pic, we have this temporary pic instead
